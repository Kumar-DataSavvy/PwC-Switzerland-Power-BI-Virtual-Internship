The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in PowerBI for call canter manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. 

Possible KPIs include:

• Overall customer satisfaction

• Overall calls answered/abandoned

• Calls by time

• Average speed of answer

• Agents performance quadrant -> average handle time(talk duration) vs calls answered

The Dataset used for this analysis was presented by PWC Switzerland and available at their official website page.

(I also Uploaded the Dataset in the Task file folder.)

##### Step 2-Cleaning data

Data transformation was done in Power Query and the dataset was loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for modelling.

The call canter dataset is given by a table named:

• Call Center which has 10 columns and 5000 rows of observation.
